A tool that can be used to verify BC breaks between two versions
of a PHP library.

**This fork changes internal classes and methods interpretation according to [PHPStan backward compatibility promise](https://phpstan.org/developing-extensions/backward-compatibility-promise).**

## Pre-requisites/assumptions

 * Your project uses `git`
 * Your project uses `composer.json` to define its dependencies
 * All source paths are covered by an `"autoload"` section in `composer.json`
 * Changes need to be committed to `git` to be covered. You can implement your own logic to extract sources and dependencies from a project though.

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev ondrejmirtes/backward-compatibility-check
```

## Usage

### Adding to a continuous integration pipeline

The typical intended usage is to just add `roave-backward-compatibility-check`
to your CI build:

```bash
vendor/bin/roave-backward-compatibility-check
```

This will automatically detect the last minor version tagged, and
compare the API against the current `HEAD`. If any BC breaks are found,
the tool returns a non-zero status, which on most CI systems will cause
the build to fail.

*NOTE:* detecting the base version only works if you have git tags in
the SemVer-compliant `x.y.z` format, such as `1.2.3`.

*NOTE:* since this tool relies on tags, you need to make sure tags are fetched
as part of your CI pipeline. For example in a GitHub action, note the use of
[`fetch-depth: 0`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#fetch-all-history-for-all-tags-and-branches):

```yaml
jobs:
  roave-backwards-compatibility-check:
    name: Roave Backwards Compatibility Check
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          with:
            fetch-depth: 0
        - name: "Install PHP"
          uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
          with:
            php-version: "8.0"
        - name: "Install dependencies"
          run: "composer install"
        - name: "Check for BC breaks"
          run: "vendor/bin/roave-backward-compatibility-check"
```
